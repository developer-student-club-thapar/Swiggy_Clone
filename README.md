     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/swiggy-clone.git
     ```

2. **Create Your Folder:**
   - Inside the cloned repository, create a new folder with your name. This folder will be your workspace for the project.

     ```bash
     cd swiggy-clone
     mkdir YourName
     ```

3. **Create Your Flutter Project:**
   - Navigate to your folder (`YourName`) and create a new Flutter project.

     cd YourName
     flutter create .
     ```

4. **Work on Your Project:**

   - Be creative with the design while adhering to the basic structure of the splash screen and login/signup page.

5. **Write Your README:**
   - Create a detailed README file within your folder explaining your implementation.
   - Include information about the screens you implemented, any additional features, and any challenges you faced and how you overcame them.

6. **Push Your Changes:**
   - Commit and push your changes to your forked repository on GitHub.

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Added Swiggy UI implementation"
     git push origin main
     ```

7. **Create a Pull Request (PR):**
   - Create a Pull Request from your forked repository to the original repository.
   - In the description, summarize your changes and include a link to your specific README file.
   - Wait for your PR to be reviewed and merged.

By following these steps, each contributor can maintain their own version of the Swiggy UI implementation within their respective folders. This approach ensures a clean and organized way to showcase individual contributions.
